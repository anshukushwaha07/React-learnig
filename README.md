# React-learnig

A collection of small React experiments, demos, and practice projects

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository hosts multiple mini React projects and examples built while learning React.  
Each folder (e.g. `01basicreact`, `02counter`, `03TailwindProps`, etc.) represents a separate small demo / exercise illustrating a specific concept in React.

## 🧩 How to Run a Demo Locally

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anshukushwaha07/React-learnig.git

## 🧩 How to Run a Demo Locally

Navigate into the demo folder you want to run, for example:

```bash
cd React-learnig/02counter
```

## Install dependencies (if the demo uses npm/yarn):

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```
## Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

- Open the browser — usually at http://localhost:3000 (or as shown in the terminal).

## 📝 Tips & Suggestions

- Fork or clone and experiment with the code

- Add new demos (e.g. API fetching, routing, form handling)

- Document each demo folder with a mini README.md for clarity

- Use separate branches for bigger experiments

## 🙏 Contribution & Feedback

- Contributions of new demos, bug fixes, or improvements are welcome!

- Open an issue if you find problems

- Submit a pull request if you’d like to add or improve something

## 💡 Happy Learning React!
